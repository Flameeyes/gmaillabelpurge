gmaillabelpurge.py allows you to delete all messages from given gmail labels when they reach a certain age.

It uses gmail's IMAP interface so you'll have to setup IMAP for your account, apart from that it just needs Python and the Python standard library.

HOW TO USE:

Open the file ~/.gmaillabelpurge with your favourite text editor. Take this example as a template for what to put in:

username=myuser@gmail.com
password=MYPASSWORD
maxage=30
labels=LABEL1,LABEL2

After "username" put your gmail user, after "password" your password (no surprises there).
maxage is the maximum age (in days) for a mail in order for in to be kept around (as in not moved to gmail trash). Just enter something integer-y cause I don't really do anything smart here. If you enter "-1" it will move all your mails in the given label to the trash.
Finally labels is a comma-delimited list of the labels you want purged.

To run the program just run 'gmaillabelpurge.py' (if it's executable) or 'python gmaillabelpurge.py'. You can get a verbose run by appending '-v' or '--verbose'. To test the system before it breaks stuff use the '--pretend' (-p) option. '-h' gives help.
